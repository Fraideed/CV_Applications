## About this repo
  This repo contains some interesting cv applications,mainly deeplearning-based;

  The main purpose of this repo is not to help you train a new model,even we may add train or finetune code in some project,but help you to use cv pretrained models;
 
  we add [wiki](https://github.com/LianShuaiLong/CV_Applications/wiki) to help you understand the theory/method of each application!
  
  Enjoy yourself!
  

## To do
- [x] 1.update wiki of neural style transfer 

- [x] 2.update matting project

- [x] 3.update wiki of matting

- [ ] 4.add fintune code of matting/modnet
